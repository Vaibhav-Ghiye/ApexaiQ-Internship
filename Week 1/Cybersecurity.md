# 🛡️ Cybersecurity – Research Notes

##  1. What is Cybersecurity?

Cybersecurity is the **practice of protecting systems, networks, and data** from digital attacks, theft, and damage.
It involves a **combination of technologies, processes, and best practices** to ensure confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information.

**Core Goals (CIA Triad):**

* **C** – **Confidentiality** 🕵️‍♂️ → Protect sensitive information from unauthorized access.
* **I** – **Integrity** ✅ → Ensure data is accurate and unchanged.
* **A** – **Availability** 🌐 → Ensure systems and data are accessible when needed.

##  2. Why is Cybersecurity Important?

Cybersecurity is **critical** because:

* 🌍 The **global cost of cybercrime** is projected to reach **\$10.5 trillion annually by 2025**.
* 📈 Increased digitalization → more entry points for cyberattacks.
* ⚠️ Protects from threats like **phishing, ransomware, data breaches**.
* 📜 Helps meet **compliance requirements** like GDPR, HIPAA, ISO 27001.
* 💼 Maintains customer trust and brand reputation.

##  3. Types of Cybersecurity

| **Type**                    | **Description**                       | **Example Threats**                 |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| **Network Security**      | Protects networks from intrusions.    | DDoS attacks, MITM                  |
| **Application Security**  | Secures software and apps.            | SQL Injection, XSS                  |
| **Cloud Security**        | Protects cloud-based assets.          | Misconfigurations, Account Takeover |
| **Endpoint Security**     | Safeguards individual devices.        | Malware, Ransomware                 |
| **Data Security**         | Protects stored and transmitted data. | Data leaks, Insider threats         |

##  4. Common Cyber Threats

* **Phishing ** – Fake emails tricking users into giving credentials.
* **Ransomware ** – Locks files until a ransom is paid.
* **Malware ** – Malicious software that damages systems.
* **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) ** – Attackers intercept communications.
* **Zero-Day Exploits ** – Attacks before a vulnerability is patched.

##  5. Cybersecurity Best Practices

* ✔ **Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** 🔑 
* ✔ **Keep software up to date** 📅
* ✔ **Use strong, unique passwords** 🔐
* ✔ **Regularly back up important data** 💾
* ✔ **Implement least privilege access** 🛂
* ✔ **Conduct employee security training** 🎓

##  6. Cybersecurity in Organizations

Organizations like ApexaiQ focus on **IT asset visibility & compliance**, which is a **crucial subset of cybersecurity**.

* Helps in **patch management** to prevent exploits.
* Improves **incident response times**.
* Ensures **audit readiness** for security frameworks.

##  7. Case Studies in Cybersecurity

* **WannaCry Ransomware (2017)**  – Affected 200,000+ computers globally due to outdated Windows systems.
* **Target Data Breach (2013)**  – Hackers stole 40M+ credit card records via a compromised third-party vendor.
* **Equifax Breach (2017)**  – 147M+ personal records leaked due to an unpatched vulnerability.
