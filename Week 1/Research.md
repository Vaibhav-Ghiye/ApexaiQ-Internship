# Cybersecurity Concepts & ApexaiQ Research

## 1. ApexaiQ Score

A proprietary metric that assesses the overall security posture of IT assets by evaluating risk, compliance, and maintenance status. This helps prioritize remediation and resource allocation.

## 2. IT Asset Management (ITAM)

The disciplined process of tracking, managing, and optimizing IT assets—such as hardware, software, and network devices—across their entire lifecycle to ensure efficiency, cost-effectiveness, security, and compliance.

## 3. Vulnerabilities

Flaws or weaknesses in software, systems, or network configurations that can be exploited by threat actors to compromise confidentiality, integrity, or availability.

## 4. Obsolescence

The condition where technology becomes outdated or unsupported, resulting in security vulnerabilities, degraded performance, and increased operational risk.

## 5. Compliance

The act of adhering to regulatory standards, legal requirements, and industry best practices (for example, HIPAA or ISO 27001) to ensure data protection and avoid penalties.

## 6. Maintenance

Regular system upkeep including applying patches, conducting updates, and performing optimizations to maintain asset performance, availability, and security.

## 7. End of Life (EOL), End of Support (EOS), End of Maintenance (EOM)

EOL refers to when a product is no longer sold; EOS means it no longer receives vendor updates; and EOM signifies that no further fixes or maintenance actions are provided.

## 8. Asset Hygiene

The practice of continually reviewing and cleaning IT environments—removing unnecessary, outdated, or unauthorized assets—to reduce risk and improve operational clarity.

## 9. Crown Jewel

Refers to the most critical assets or datasets within an organization—such as proprietary systems or sensitive customer data—that require focused protection strategies.

## 10. Inventory

A comprehensive registry of all IT assets along with their configurations, locations, and status that underpins visibility and control.

## 11. NVD (National Vulnerability Database)

A centralized repository maintained by NIST documenting publicly known software and system vulnerabilities along with Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs).

## 12. Patch Management

The structured process of identifying, testing, and deploying patches to mitigate vulnerabilities and enhance system functionality.

## 13. Data Breaches

Security incidents where unauthorized entities gain access to sensitive information, often resulting in reputational damage and financial losses.

## 14. MSP (Managed Service Provider)

An external partner responsible for managing IT infrastructure and cybersecurity services—sometimes including full asset management—for client organizations.

## 15. Device Types

Categories under ITAM that include various endpoints such as servers, desktops, laptops, mobile devices, IoT elements, and virtual machines.

## 16. True SaaS

A software delivery model where applications are fully cloud-native, accessible via web interfaces, and do not require local installation or infrastructure.

## 17. Inbound/Outbound Integration

Inbound integration refers to data flowing into a system from external sources; outbound integration involves data leaving the system toward external platforms or workflows.

## 18. Compliance Standards

Key frameworks and roles governing cybersecurity and data protection:

* CISA: U.S. government cybersecurity guidance.
* CISO: Officer responsible for organizational information security strategy.
* HIPAA: Regulation for protecting health data.
* ISO 27001: International standard for information security management systems.

## 19. Perimeter

The network’s edge—the traditional boundary between an organization’s internal systems and external threats, now evolving with cloud and zero-trust environments.

## 20. ROI (Return on Investment) and KPI (Key Performance Indicators)

ROI measures the financial return on cybersecurity or IT investments. KPIs are metrics used to evaluate the effectiveness of those initiatives, such as reduction in vulnerabilities or mean time to remediation.

## 21. Auto-Remediation

Automated systems that detect issues—like vulnerabilities or compliance gaps—and initiate remediation actions without manual intervention.

## 22. Network Protocols

Set rules and standards that govern communication across networks—examples include TCP/IP, HTTP, and DNS—which asset management systems must interpret and handle.

## 23. Due Diligence

A comprehensive process of evaluating risks, performance, and security posture—especially in vendor evaluation or acquisitions—to ensure informed decision-making.

## 24. SOAR (Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response)

A technology framework that consolidates security tools and automates incident response workflows to improve threat detection and response speed.

## 25. Role of ITAM in Zero Trust Security Models

ITAM supports zero trust by ensuring all assets are continuously identified, validated, and granted the least necessary privileges before gaining access—reinforcing continuous verification.

## 26. Cyber Asset Attack Surface Management (CAASM)

An advanced cybersecurity approach that continuously discovers, inventories, and assesses all digital assets—including unknown or shadow IT—across cloud, on-premise, and hybrid environments. It aggregates data from multiple tools to provide a unified, real-time view of attack surfaces, prioritize risk, and streamline remediation efforts.
