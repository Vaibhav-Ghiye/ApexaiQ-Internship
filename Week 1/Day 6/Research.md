# Common Cyberattacks and solutions

Here is an overview of common cyberattacks along with explanations and solutions for each:

### 1. Malware
- **Description:** Malicious software designed to damage, disrupt, or gain unauthorized access to systems. Varieties include viruses, worms, ransomware, and spyware.
- **Solutions:** Use updated antivirus software, regularly patch systems, avoid suspicious downloads, and backup important data frequently.

### 2. Phishing
- **Description:** Deceptive attempt to trick users into revealing sensitive information like passwords or credit card numbers, often via fraudulent emails or messages.
- **Solutions:** Educate users on recognizing phishing attempts, avoid clicking unknown links, verify sender authenticity, and implement email filtering.

### 3. Password Attacks
- **Description:** Attempts to obtain passwords through brute force, dictionary attacks, or credential stuffing.
- **Solutions:** Enforce strong password policies, implement multi-factor authentication (MFA), use account lockouts after repeated failed attempts, and encourage password managers.

### 4. Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) Attack
- **Description:** Overwhelm a network or website by flooding it with excessive traffic from multiple compromised devices, leading to service disruption.
- **Solutions:** Deploy DDoS mitigation services, increase network bandwidth, use firewalls and intrusion detection systems, and have an incident response plan.

### 5. Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack
- **Description:** Interceptor eavesdrops or alters communication between two parties without their knowledge.
- **Solutions:** Use encrypted connections (HTTPS, VPNs), enable strong authentication, and avoid unsecured public Wi-Fi networks.

### 6. Drive-By Downloads
- **Description:** Unintentional download of malicious code when visiting compromised or malicious websites.
- **Solutions:** Keep browsers and plugins updated, use web filters, avoid suspicious websites, and deploy anti-malware solutions.

### 7. Malvertising
- **Description:** Malicious advertisements embedded with code that redirects users to harmful sites or downloads malware.
- **Solutions:** Use ad blockers, validate ad sources, monitor site traffic for suspicious activity, and employ advanced threat protection tools.

### 8. Rogue Software
- **Description:** Fake software posing as legitimate security or utility applications but actually causing harm or stealing data.
- **Solutions:** Download only from trusted sources, verify software legitimacy, keep antivirus updated, and educate users about fake software risks.

### 9. Additional Common Attacks:

- **Ransomware:** Malware that encrypts data and demands payment for the decryption key. Prevention includes regular backups, patching, and email filtering.
- **SQL Injection:** Attackers insert malicious SQL commands into input fields to access or manipulate databases. Use parameterized queries and web application firewalls.
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Attackers inject malicious scripts into webpages viewed by others. Prevent by sanitizing inputs and implementing Content Security Policy.
- **Botnets:** Networks of infected devices controlled remotely to perform coordinated attacks like spam or DDoS. Use endpoint security and network monitoring.
- **Watering Hole Attacks:** Compromising websites frequently visited by targets to distribute malware. Use threat intelligence and avoid suspicious sites.
