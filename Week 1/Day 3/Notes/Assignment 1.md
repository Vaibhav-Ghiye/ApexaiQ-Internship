# **Web Scraping – Overview & Implementation in Python**

## **1. Introduction**

Web Scraping is the process of **automatically extracting information** from websites using code. Instead of manually copying and pasting, we write scripts that:

1. Send a request to the webpage.
2. Download its HTML code.
3. Parse the HTML to locate required data.
4. Store the data in a structured format (CSV, JSON, database).

Web scraping is widely used for:

* Price monitoring in e-commerce.
* News aggregation.
* Market research.
* Collecting data for machine learning.

## **2. How Web Scraping Works**

The process can be divided into four main steps:

1. **Sending an HTTP Request**
   The scraper sends a request (usually a `GET` request) to the target website’s URL to fetch its content.

2. **Receiving the Response**
   The server sends back the HTML content of the webpage.

3. **Parsing HTML**
   The HTML code is processed to extract the desired elements such as text, links, tables, images, etc.

4. **Saving Data**
   Extracted data can be stored in formats like CSV, Excel, JSON, or inserted into a database.

## **3. Common Python Libraries for Web Scraping**

* **`selenium`** → Automates browsers for scraping JavaScript-rendered pages.
* **`requests`** → Sends HTTP requests to websites and retrieves the HTML content.
* **`BeautifulSoup`** (`bs4`) → Parses HTML/XML content and extracts data easily.
* **`lxml`** → Fast HTML/XML parser, alternative to BeautifulSoup’s default parser.
* **`pandas`** → Handles tabular data and allows saving to CSV/Excel.

## **4. Example – Scraping Quotes**

```python
from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By
from selenium.webdriver.chrome.service import Service
from selenium.webdriver.chrome.options import Options
import time

class QuoteScraper:
    def __init__(self, driver_path):
        chrome_options = Options()
        chrome_options.add_argument("--headless")  # Run without opening browser window
        self.driver = webdriver.Chrome(service=Service(driver_path), options=chrome_options)

    def scrape_quotes(self, url):
        self.driver.get(url)
        time.sleep(2)  # Allow page to load
        
        quotes = self.driver.find_elements(By.CLASS_NAME, "text")
        authors = self.driver.find_elements(By.CLASS_NAME, "author")
        
        for quote, author in zip(quotes, authors):
            print(f"{quote.text} — {author.text}")

    def close_browser(self):
        self.driver.quit()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    DRIVER_PATH = "path/to/chromedriver"  # Replace with your path
    scraper = QuoteScraper(DRIVER_PATH)
    scraper.scrape_quotes("https://quotes.toscrape.com/")
    scraper.close_browser()
```

## **6. Best Practices in Web Scraping**

* **Check `robots.txt`** → Ensure scraping is allowed for the site.
* **Use delays** → Add `time.sleep()` between requests to avoid server overload.
* **Use headers** → Mimic a real browser to prevent blocking.
* **Avoid scraping sensitive/private data**.
* **Respect website terms of service**.
* For large-scale scraping, use **proxies** or **rotating IPs**.

## **7. Limitations of Web Scraping**

* Websites can block scrapers using CAPTCHAs or IP bans.
* HTML structures change, breaking the scraper.
* Legal restrictions may apply depending on the website.

---

## **8. Real-World Applications**

* Collecting product details from e-commerce websites.
* Gathering news articles from various sources.
* Monitoring competitor prices and stock levels.
* Aggregating reviews or feedback data.
* Conducting large-scale data-driven research.

## **9. Conclusion**

Web scraping is a powerful technique for data collection, but it must be used ethically and responsibly. Python’s `Selenium`, `requests`, `BeautifulSoup`, and `pandas` libraries make it easy to extract and store useful information from websites.
