# Selenium – Web Scraping & Web Automation 

## 1. Introduction

**Selenium** is an open-source tool primarily used for **web browser automation**. While it is widely known for automating testing processes, it can also be used for **web scraping** when interacting with dynamic websites that load content via JavaScript.


---

## 2. Key Features

* **Cross-browser support** (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari)
* **Supports multiple programming languages** (Python, Java, C#, JavaScript, etc.)
* Can handle **JavaScript-rendered content**
* Allows **interaction with dynamic web elements** (forms, dropdowns, pop-ups)
* Supports **headless mode** for faster, invisible scraping

## 3. Components of Selenium

1. **Selenium WebDriver** – API to interact with browsers programmatically
2. **Selenium IDE** – Record & playback tool for quick test automation
3. **Selenium Grid** – For parallel execution across multiple machines

For scraping purposes, we mainly use **Selenium WebDriver**.

## 4. Workflow of Selenium for Web Scraping

1. **Install Selenium** and a browser driver (e.g., ChromeDriver)
2. **Launch browser** using Selenium WebDriver
3. **Navigate to the target website**
4. **Locate elements** using locators:

   * `find_element_by_id`
   * `find_element_by_name`
   * `find_element_by_class_name`
   * `find_element_by_xpath`
   * `find_element_by_css_selector`
5. **Extract the required data** using `.text` or `.get_attribute()`
6. **Store the data** in a file or database
7. **Close the browser**

## 5. Advantages of Selenium for Web Scraping

* Handles **AJAX requests** and **dynamic content**
* Can **simulate human-like browsing behavior**
* Supports **cookies and session handling**
* Works with **headless browsers** for performance

---

## 6. Limitations

* Slower compared to BeautifulSoup or Scrapy because it renders the full webpage
* Requires a browser driver to be installed
* Some websites have **anti-bot detection**, which may block Selenium scripts

## 7. Basic Example – Extract Page Title

```python
from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By

# Initialize WebDriver
driver = webdriver.Chrome()

# Open a website
driver.get("https://example.com")

# Get page title
print("Page Title:", driver.title)

# Close browser
driver.quit()
```

## 8. Use Cases

* **Automated testing** of web apps
* **Scraping dynamic websites** (e.g., product listings, job postings)
* **Form submissions** and **data entry automation**
* **Automated report generation** from online dashboards
