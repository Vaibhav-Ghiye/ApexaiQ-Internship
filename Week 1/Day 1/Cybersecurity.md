# üõ°Ô∏è Cybersecurity ‚Äì Research Notes

##  1. What is Cybersecurity?

Cybersecurity is the **practice of protecting systems, networks, and data** from digital attacks, theft, and damage.
It involves a **combination of technologies, processes, and best practices** to ensure confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information.

**Core Goals (CIA Triad):**

* **C** ‚Äì **Confidentiality**  ‚Üí Protect sensitive information from unauthorized access.
* **I** ‚Äì **Integrity** ‚Üí Ensure data is accurate and unchanged.
* **A** ‚Äì **Availability** ‚Üí Ensure systems and data are accessible when needed.

##  2. Why is Cybersecurity Important?

Cybersecurity is **critical** because:

*  The **global cost of cybercrime** is projected to reach **\$10.5 trillion annually by 2025**.
*  Increased digitalization ‚Üí more entry points for cyberattacks.
*  Protects from threats like **phishing, ransomware, data breaches**.
*  Helps meet **compliance requirements** like GDPR, HIPAA, ISO 27001.
*  Maintains customer trust and brand reputation.

##  3. Types of Cybersecurity

| **Type**                    | **Description**                       | **Example Threats**                 |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| **Network Security**      | Protects networks from intrusions.    | DDoS attacks, MITM                  |
| **Application Security**  | Secures software and apps.            | SQL Injection, XSS                  |
| **Cloud Security**        | Protects cloud-based assets.          | Misconfigurations, Account Takeover |
| **Endpoint Security**     | Safeguards individual devices.        | Malware, Ransomware                 |
| **Data Security**         | Protects stored and transmitted data. | Data leaks, Insider threats         |

##  4. Common Cyber Threats

* **Phishing ** ‚Äì Fake emails tricking users into giving credentials.
* **Ransomware ** ‚Äì Locks files until a ransom is paid.
* **Malware ** ‚Äì Malicious software that damages systems.
* **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) ** ‚Äì Attackers intercept communications.
* **Zero-Day Exploits ** ‚Äì Attacks before a vulnerability is patched.

##  5. Cybersecurity Best Practices

* ‚úî **Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** 
* ‚úî **Keep software up to date** 
* ‚úî **Use strong, unique passwords** 
* ‚úî **Regularly back up important data** 
* ‚úî **Implement least privilege access** 
* ‚úî **Conduct employee security training**
