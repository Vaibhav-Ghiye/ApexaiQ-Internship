#  ApexaiQ – Competitor Landscape & Industry Perspective

##  Overview
- *What:* Unified platform for IT asset intelligence + cybersecurity risk management.  
- *Who:* IT and Security teams.  
- *Where:* Cloud, on-prem, hybrid, remote environments.  

---

##  Industry Pain Points
- Incomplete visibility (shadow IT, cloud, IoT often missed).  
- Too many isolated tools → scattered/unreliable data.  
- Outdated or inconsistent asset/risk data.  
- Rising compliance and audit pressures.  
- MSPs need multi-tenant visibility + SLA management.  

---

## ApexaiQ Core Features
- Complete *asset discovery* across environments (cloud, remote, IoT).  
- Centralized *risk scoring* (vulnerabilities, configs, compliance).  
- Real-time data enrichment & updating.  
- Customizable dashboards (for IT, security & executives).  
- Automated workflows (remediation, escalation, assignments).  
- SLA tracking across risk types (not just vulnerabilities).  
- Integrations: ITSM, EDR, IAM, vulnerability scanners, cloud platforms.

 *ApexaiQ Advantage:* Combines *assets + vulnerabilities + remediation* in one view, supports *multi-tenancy* and *SLA tracking*.  

---

##  Why These Features Matter
- *First Seen / Last Seen Dates* → Track vuln lifecycle, prove compliance.  
- *MTTR (Mean Time To Repair)* → Measure remediation speed and risk response.  
- *Role-Based Access* → Enforces least privilege for compliance/security.  
- *Custom Vulnerability SLAs* → Different deadlines per severity/asset class.  
- *Non-CVE Vulnerabilities* → Broader coverage of exposures beyond CVEs.
